One week from today on February 3, the Magma community will be hosting the Magma Developers Conference. This virtual conference will be an opportunity to hear from Magma developers as they share more about the growing Magma community and how the platform enables service providers and systems integrators to deploy faster and more efficient networks. The schedule includes Magma use cases, a 5G demo, and other talks about the state of the project.  We are especially excited to hear a keynote from Facebook’s Yael Maguire and to share how to run Magma’s AGW on public cloud services like AWS.
