| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Premier Member\*                                                                           | \$100,000                    |
| General Member\*\*                                                                         | See fee scale below          |
| Associate Member (pre-approved non-profits, open source projects, and government entities) | \$0                          |
| Ecosystem Member (Associate Members appointed by the Governing Board)                      | \$0                          |

<br/>
*Premier membership requires an initial two-year membership commitment. One year’s fees are due on acceptance as a member, and the second year’s fees are due at the first anniversary of membership. At the second anniversary of membership, if membership is not canceled at least thirty days prior to the second anniversary of membership, a prorated amount of the applicable fees for the remainder of that calendar year (a “stub period”) will be invoiced (and membership will proceed on a calendar-year based renewal cycle thereafter).
<br/><br/>
**The annual fee for General membership is determined according to the following table, based on your current consolidated employee headcount:

<br/><br/>

| Consolidated Employees  | Annual General Membership Fees |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 5,000 and above         | \$50,000                       |
| Between 2,000 and 4,999 | \$25,000                       |
| Between 500 and 1,999   | \$10,000                       |
| Up to 499               | \$0                            |

<br/>
Your organization will need to be a current member of the Linux Foundation. If your organization is already a member of the LF, there is no need to do anything. If you are not a member of the LF, there are three tiers of LF membership available.
