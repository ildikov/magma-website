        Mark has been lucky enough to participate in many disruptive technology shifts, from the introduction of the first GPUs at Dell in the 90s as a product manager, to the digital music/MP3 transition at Musicmatch as Director of Business Development. After Yahoo! acquired Musicmatch, combining the #1 streaming radio service with the #1 digital music app, Mark served as Sr Director, establishing strategic partnerships for one of the first on demand streaming music services. In 2009, Mark joined Rackspace, an early pioneer in cloud computing, as VP of Business Development, focused on building their cloud ecosystem.
        In 2010, to accelerate the cloud ecosystem's development, Mark co-founded a new open source cloud computing project called OpenStack, in partnership with NASA and 25 other organizations globally. OpenStack quickly became one of the fastest growing open source projects in history. In 2012, Mark co-founded the Open Infrastructure Foundation to manage the growth of the project, where he now serves at the COO. Today, OpenStack is one of the 3 most actively developed open source projects in the world, along with the Linux kernel and Chromium.
        <br /><br />
        Mark is now helping to expand and evolve the Open Infrastructure Foundation’s mission, bringing the unique open collaboration method established by the OpenStack community to many new open source projects across the cloud infrastructure market, including Kata Containers, the Zuul CI/CD platform, the StarlingX edge computing platform, and Airship.
